    <h1>String Tune - Js Library</h1>
    <p>
        StringTune is more than just an animation library. It is built as a flexible ecosystem that allows seamless animation integration without compromising performance or control. The core idea is declarative management through HTML and CSS, eliminating the need to write JavaScript for standard effects.
